### assignment
Giving a new value to a variable.
 
### cin
std::cin - write a value into a varibale
 
### concatenation
Joining two strings together to create a new string.
 
### definition
A declaration thatsets aside space in memory for a variable.
 
### increment
Increase by 1.
 
### initialization
Giving a value to a variable at definition.
 
### conversion
Converting a variable of a type into another type.

### name
The name we give to a variable so that we can remember it and refer to it later in the program. 
 
### declaration
Give a name to a variable without necessarily setting aside memory for it, which happens at the definition stage, but they very often happen at the same time.
 
### decrement
Decrease by 1.
 
### narrowing
Narrowing conversion happens when we cast a bigger type to a smaller type, possibly losing data (ex: from double to int).
 
### object
A region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of data can be placed there.
 
### operation
An action that can be performed on a type.
 
### operator
A symbol used for an operation.
 
### type
Defines the rules some data - possible values and operations.
 
### type safety
AN operation is type safe if it acts according to the rules of the type. Using an uninitialized variable or doing a narrowing converting is not type safe.
 
### value
Data that a variable can hold, interpreted according a type.
 
### variable
A named object.
