### abstraction
Hiding implementation details to ease use and understanding.

### computation
A computation take input and produces output.

### conditional statement
Ex: `if (x > y)`

### declaration
Creating a new variable, function or other entity.

### definition
Declaring a variable and assigning it a value as well (allocates memory for it).

### divide and conquer
Make a problem smaller and smaller by halving it every time.

### else
The other branch of `if`.

### expression
An expression produces a result when evaluated using a combination of values, variables, operators and function calls.

### for-statement
A control flow statement used for looping which allows repeated execution of code using an initialized, a condition and execution (usually on the initialized variable).

### range-for-statement
A for statement that loops through all the elements of a container.

### repetition
A repetition executes code multiple times.

### rvalue
A value that can only be on the right side of a an operation, like a literal. It cannot be assigned a new value.

### selection
Control flow - choosing which code to execute.

### size()
Return the size of a container.

### sort()
Sorts the elements of a container.

### statement
An instruction the program executes.

### switch-statement
A control flow statement that choses which code to execute based on the value of a parameter checked against integer literals (the literal that is equal to the parameter is executed - and the rest if `break` is missing).

### function
A separate block of code that serves a purpose and has a name. (A named sequence of statements.)

### if-statement
A control flow statement that chooses to execute piece of code if the condition provided is true.

### increment
Increase by 1.

### input
Data that is passed to a program to be used or processed.

### iteration
A step of a loop.

### loop
Repetition of code.

### lvalue
A value that can only be on the left side of a an operation, like a variable. On the left side of '=' or in contexts on assignment: `int lvalue(5);`.

### member function
A defined function for a class.

### output
The result of a computation.

### push_back()
Adds a new element to a vector.

### vector
A container of elements stored contiguously in memory of dynamic size.

### while-statement
A loop that repeats until the condition provided is false.
