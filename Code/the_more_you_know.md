# The More You Know
*Information that I did not know (or forgot) before starting to read the book.*
 
- Binary intergers are respresented starting with 0b or 0B (since C++ 14). Example: 0b0010 (2 in base 10).
- Base 8 integers are represented starting with a 0. Example: 0123 = 1 * 8^2^ + 2 * 8 + 3 = 63 in base 10.
- Floating point literals scientfic notation: 1.23e3 = 1230.0 (1.23 * 10^3^ ); 1.23e-3 = 0.00123 (1.23 * 10^-3^).
